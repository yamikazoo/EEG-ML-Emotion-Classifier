# EEECDL (Electroencephalo-emotional Classifer via Deep Learning)

This is a deep learning system that classifies human emotions from EEG (electroencephalography) brain signals. Using a custom 1D CNN built with PyTorch, the model analyzes brainwave patterns from 14 EEG channels to predict emotional states across 27 different emotion categories. The system employs feature engineering techniques including statistical feature extraction, asymmetry feature computation, and Random Forest-based feature selection to identify the most discriminative patterns in EEG data. The project includes a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation with an interactive Gradio web interface that allows users to upload their own EEG data and receive real-time emotion predictions with confidence scores.

**Key Technologies:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

```bash
repository
├── src                          ## source code of the package itself
    ├── data                     ## code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the EEGDataSet class
    ├── model                    ## code for 1-D CNN class and training
    ├── utils                    ## utility

├── requirements.txt             ## If you use conda
```

<a name="installation"></a>

## 2. Installation and Training

Install the project.

1. Create the virtual environment
   ```shell
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment (this may take a while on CSIL)

    **macOS / Linux**
   ```shell
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
    **Windows**
   ```shell
    .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies using the requirements file (there are many to install so this may take additional time). 
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt <---- this will be found in this repo, so cd into the repo first
   ```
3. If you update the dependencies, remember to freeze it and commit the changes to the requirements.txt everytime.
   ```shell
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

## 3. Reproduction
Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huytungst/EEGEmotions-27.git
cd EEGEmotions-27
```
Windows Powershell
````powershell
Move-Item -Path "path\to\EEGEmotions-27\training\eeg_features_extracted.csv" -Destination "path\to\2025_3_project_06\src\"
````

Linux/macOS
````bash
mv /path/to/EEGEmotions-27/training/eeg_features_extracted.csv /path/to/2025_3_project_06/src/
````

If you wish the rename the file, or change the path overall, you have to change `CSV_FILE_PATH` parameter under `src/config.py`
````python
class Config:
...
CSV_FILE_PATH = "eeg_features_extracted.csv" <---- CHANGE YOUR .csv PATH HERE
 ...
````

To train the model, simply cd into the repo and run
````bash
python src/main.py 
````
After training has completed, a set of charts will be created under `plots/` for accuracy and loss for training and validation loops, as well as a confusion matrix.

Data can be found at: [https://github.com/huytungst/EEGEmotions-27](https://github.com/huytungst/EEGEmotions-27)

Output will be saved in: `best_cnn_model.pth` (our model with the best model weights)

## 4. Using the Gradio Web Interface

After training the model, you can use the interactive Gradio web application to make predictions on new EEG data.

### Running the Application

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (see step 2 in Installation)

2. From the project root directory, run:
   ```bash
   python src/run.py
   ```

3. The application will start and display a local URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:7860`)

4. Open the URL in your web browser

### Using the Interface

The application has two tabs:

#### **User Upload Prediction** (Default Tab)
Upload your own EEG data files to get emotion predictions.

- **Download Sample Dataset**: Click the download button to get a sample CSV file (`sample_eeg_dataset.csv`) that demonstrates the correct format
- **Upload EEG Data File**: Upload a CSV file with pre-extracted EEG features
  - Must contain 14 channels with ~35 features each per sample
  - Asymmetry features are computed automatically
  - Supported formats: `.csv`
- **Results**: The model will display:
  - Predicted emotion probabilities for the first sample (top 5 emotions shown)
  - Confidence scores for all uploaded samples (up to 10 samples shown in detail)

#### **Training Data Viewer** (Second Tab)
Browse predictions on the training dataset to see how the model performs.

- Use the slider to select a sample index (0 to number of samples - 1)
- View:
  - Ground truth emotion label from the training data
  - Model's predicted emotion
  - Prediction confidence scores (top 5 emotions)
  - Participant ID and Cowen label information

### CSV Format Requirements

Your uploaded CSV file should match the training data format:
- **Columns**: Features for 14 EEG channels (e.g., `min_1`, `max_1`, `mean_1`, `ar1_1`, ..., `min_14`, `max_14`, etc.)
- **Rows**: Each row represents one EEG sample
- **No labels needed**: The model will predict the emotion labels

**Tip**: Download and examine the sample dataset from the web interface to see the exact format required.
